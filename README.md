# Predicting Health Risks from Twitter using Multi Task Learning

This is a replication of the work from this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.2195). I implemented the baseline for predicting health risks such as: obesity rate and overweight rate by analyzing the tweet data. [Scikit Learn SVM](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html) has been used for classification tasks. In order to run the project using Python, user has to install scikit learn and nltk. But using the Dockerfile is more convenient as it takes care of the dependencies.
